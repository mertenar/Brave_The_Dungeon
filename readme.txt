****OVERVIEW****
This is an adventure game that gives choices via text output for The Player to input responses.
There is one "way" to win. There are many ways to lose, but lose is the only other outcome.
The game is a sequence of rooms The Player must complete.
The Player has lives and will lose a life for wrong choices. When life = 0 it's game over.
    - losing a life will result in the player replaying their mistake
    - # of lives is easily editable in the code, found at the end of the script.
    - By editing lives this would increase or decrease the difficulty of the game

****ITEMS/GOLD****
Players can access an inventory and merchant between scenes (sometimes even within a scene)
Players are given a starting amount of gold. Gold is required to purchase items.
    - Gold amount can also be easily edited at the end of the script.
    - Gold can be increased in the game via the race betting room. There is no max here.
Items are mandatory for the player to proceed past certain rooms.

****TO IMPROVE ON****
1) Avoiding using global declarations? (gold, lives, character_name)
2) Make text speed option
